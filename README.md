K8s Practice Training
The goal of this tutorial is to give good understanding of Kubernetes and help preparing you for CKA, CKAD and CKS.

To achieve this you need running Kubernetes cluster.

During the tutorial every user is going to create personal namespace and execute all exercises there.

There are 50+ tasks with increasing difficulty. Tested with K8s version 1.19.2 and kubectl version 1.19.2.
